import { PackageManagerTabs, Badge } from '@theme';

# Quick Start

## Installation

To get started, install the package using your preferred package manager:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install react-native-legal" />

## Setup

The setup process varies depending on whether you are using Expo or a bare React Native project. Follow the steps below based on your project type.

### Expo Projects

If you are using Expo, you need to add the config plugin to your `app.json` or `app.config.js` file:

```diff
{
  "expo": {
++  "plugins": ["react-native-legal"]
  }
}
```

After adding the plugin, rebuild your app using either:

<PackageManagerTabs command="expo prebuild" />

or

<PackageManagerTabs command="eas build" />

This will ensure the required native dependencies are included.

:::warning
This library **cannot be used** in [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) because it requires custom native code.
:::

### Bare React Native Projects

For bare React Native projects, you need to run the CLI plugin to generate and include license data. Run the following command from your project root:

<PackageManagerTabs command="react-native legal-generate" />

This will extract and prepare license metadata for use in your app.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can easily add a button to your app to display the list of open-source licenses:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { Button, View } from 'react-native';
import { ReactNativeLegal } from 'react-native-legal';

function launchNotice() {
  ReactNativeLegal.launchLicenseListScreen('OSS Notice');
}

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Button 
        onPress={launchNotice} 
        title="Open source licenses" 
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```

This will open a native screen listing all detected licenses. The title of the screen can be customized by passing a different string argument to `launchLicenseListScreen()`.

## License Display in Settings <Badge text="iOS" type="info" />

On **iOS**, all detected licenses will also appear in the **Settings app** under the app's information section. This is done to comply with **Apple's guidelines**, which require apps to provide open-source license acknowledgments in a visible location.

## Monorepo License Handling

:::warning
`react-native-legal` only detects licenses for dependencies listed in the app's `package.json`. It won't include dependencies used only in monorepo packages unless they are also in `package.json`. To include more licenses, add those dependencies to the app's `package.json`.
